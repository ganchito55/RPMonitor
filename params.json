The server reads this file and then it send it, but it replaces the variables by the results.\r\n* the vars file with all variables and how to resolve them. It use the following format $var$'TAB'command\r\n\r\nManage shell script is only for developers and people who want to change and test the server\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\nYou need gcc and other developer tools. I will try to upload the last build for non developers.\r\nI think that if you have installed build-essential you won't need any dependencies more.\r\n\r\nCompile the file server.c\r\n\r\n$ gcc server.c -o server\r\n\r\n## How to install and configure\r\nYou only have to run server ($ ./server ). You can change de variables and add the information that you want to monitor.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\nWhen server is running, with a web browser enter yourRaspberryIP:5555 and you can show all the information.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Variables and more\r\nI try do not use third party software because I think that the software should be run without other dependencies, so I hope that others will follow this advice. But this is only an advice.\r\n\r\nHelp me to increase the vars file with all variables that you think that it would be interesting to monitor!!\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nThe code to create the server and manage a TCP connection was obtained from [here](http://www.kumanov.com/docs/prog/Advanced%20Systems%20Programming%20And%20Real%20-%20Time%20Systems%20&%20Real-%20Time%20Operating%20Systems%20And%20Device%20Programming/RTGIF031.HTM)\r\nI use [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons in the project \r\nthanks so much\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
